># Abstract

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text. This code implements sentiment analysis using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model in Python with TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The sentiment analysis is performed on a dataset of tweets related to airline experiences, focusing on classifying the sentiment as either positive or negative.

## Dataset Preprocessing

The code begins by loading the dataset from a CSV file using the pandas library. The dataset contains columns such as 'text' (tweet text) and 'airline_sentiment' (sentiment label). Neutral sentiment tweets are filtered out, as they do not contribute to sentiment classification. This step ensures that the dataset is balanced and suitable for binary sentiment analysis.

## Text Data Processing

Next, the text data is preprocessed using the Tokenizer class from Keras. The Tokenizer is used to tokenize the tweet texts, converting them into sequences of numerical tokens. This process involves assigning a unique integer to each word in the corpus and replacing words in the text with their corresponding integers. Additionally, the sequences are padded to a fixed length using the pad_sequences function. Padding ensures that all sequences have the same length, which is crucial for efficient batch processing during model training.

## Data Splitting

The dataset is then split into training and validation sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn library. This division allows for model training on a portion of the data while evaluating performance on unseen data.

## Model Building

The LSTM neural network model is constructed using the Sequential API from Keras. The model architecture includes an Embedding layer, SpatialDropout1D layer, LSTM layer, Dropout layer, and Dense layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification. The Embedding layer is responsible for learning word embeddings, which capture semantic relationships between words. Spatial dropout is applied to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping entire 1D feature maps. The LSTM layer, with its ability to capture long-term dependencies, is well-suited for sequential data like text. Dropout layers further regularize the model, reducing the risk of overfitting.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The model is compiled with binary crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer, suitable for binary classification tasks. During training, the model's performance is monitored using accuracy as the metric. The training process involves iterating over epochs and updating the model parameters to minimize the loss function.

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set to assess its generalization ability. The training history, including accuracy and loss metrics over epochs, is plotted using matplotlib for visualization. These plots provide insights into the model's learning progress and help identify potential issues such as overfitting or underfitting.

## Prediction Function

Finally, a prediction function is implemented to classify the sentiment of new input text based on the trained model. This function tokenizes and pads the input text, then uses the model to predict the sentiment label (negative or positive). The predicted label is printed to the console, allowing users to interactively test the model with custom text inputs.

In summary, this code demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for sentiment analysis using LSTM neural networks, encompassing data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction. The combination of Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras enables efficient development and deployment of deep learning models for text analysis tasks like sentiment classification.
